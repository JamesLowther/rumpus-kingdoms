 
Each user can create a kingdom, or join someone elses
Each kingdom is the capital

Kingdoms gain population by purchasing rumpus land and founding villages.
Each village has a rumpus level (this affects your kingdom's tax rate).
Rumpus levels can be improved in a village by purchasing dance floors for the village (so they can rumpus better)

Each kingdom has a military where you can purchase troop units (affect warfare)
A kingdom can attack another kingdom to possibly gain that kingdom's villages, and population
Warfare will result in lost troops for both sides, but there will only be one winner
You can buy attack troops or defence shieldmen

Winner is determined by number of troops, cumulative village rumpus level, and distance from kingdom capital

If someone manages to capture the entire map, they are the Rumpus King

Doubloons are taken from tax, RUMPUS RUNS (time when praising is accepted), and from winning warfare

A leaderboard will exist for the kingdom with the most amount of rumpus land

Users can dig for up to 3 rumpus relics per day.
