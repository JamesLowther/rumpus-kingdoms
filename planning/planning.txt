 
Each user can create a kingdom
Each kingdom is the capital

Kingdoms gain population by purchasing rumpus land and founding villages.
Each village has a rumpus level (this affects your kingdom's tax rate).
Rumpus levels can be improved in a village by purchasing dance floors for the village (so they can rumpus better)

Each kingdom has a military where you can purchase troop units (affect warfare)
A kingdom can attack another kingdom to possibly gain that kingdom's villages, and population
Warfare will result in lost troops for both sides, but there will only be one winner
You can buy attack troops or defence shieldmen

Winner is determined by number of troops, cumulative village rumpus level, and distance from kingdom capital

If someone manages to capture the entire map, they are the Rumpus King

Doubloons are taken from tax, RUMPUS RUNS (time when praising is accepted), and from winning warfare

A leaderboard will exist for the kingdom with the most amount of rumpus land

Users can dig for up to 3 rumpus relics per day.

# Warfare

User1 picks User2 to attack
User1 does not know the attack or defence of User2
User1 picks the amount of attack units to send
If User1 sends more attack units than User2 has for defence then User1 wins
If User1 does not have more attack units then User2 has for defence then User2 wins
The attacking User1 always loses all sent attack units
The defending User2 loses defence units only if they successfully attack
User1 can only attack once per day
User2 can only be attacked once per day

If User1 wins, they get User2's lowest population village
If User2 successfully defends, User2 gets User1's lowest population village
